This is a simple smart plug with the addition of a USB port, as far as I can see the USB port  is 'always on' and is not access this from the ESP module.
Opening up the device was easy, 2 screws then a small amount of gentle prying exposed the components, 2 more screws had it fully deconstructed.

## Serial Flashing

The ESP module is mounted on a pcb with all of the required pins exposed.

I was able to flash by connecting GPIO0 to GND while connecting my Serial Adaptor and flashing as per any other ESP device
